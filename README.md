# Hello-AI

> English  |  **[中文文档](./README-zh.md)**

## Overview

Aiming to connect oneself and others to the vast world of AI, this project was created with just that intention in mind.

As one of the forerunners in the advent of AI, during the peak popularity of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), this initiative provided a series of public AI services, helping some people connect to the world of AI. Time flies, and nowadays, AI is everywhere, and the public services offered have stopped for various reasons. However, the original intention of this project remains. If you're tired of dealing with domestic services that are just shells, sporadically operational, or vanish without a trace, this site may still offer you some assistance.

The project provides AI-related resources, including but not limited to:

- [ChatGPT in Chinese: A Guide](./home/chatgptPrompts.md)
- [Collection of Open Source ChatGPT Projects](./home/awesome-open-gpt.md)
- [A Compilation of Global AI Websites](./home/navigation.md)
- Trending AI News
- AI Information Exchange Groups, etc.

The project is maintained during business hours, so there might be omissions, errors, or suboptimal experiences, but the author will strive to continually optimize and improve.

If you have any AI-related information to provide or have suggestions or feedback, please submit an [issue](https://github.com/xxxily/hello-ai/issues).

## Latest Free AI Service Website Recommendations

Considering that domestic AI services like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) are not always stable, compliant, or genuine, this site prioritizes AI services offered by foreign service providers.

For the websites listed below, if access is restricted, please refer to the contents of [VPN Tools](./home/airport.md).

### [deepseek.com](https://chat.deepseek.com/) Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Reasons for Recommendation:

- Currently the strongest free open-source text generation model
- Became a highly sought-after model both domestically and internationally
- Intelligence level rivals or even surpasses GPT's latest models
- Forced many AI companies to rush to release stronger AI models
- Compelled many AI companies to reduce prices or offer better free services
- Numerous manufacturers and platforms actively deploy deepseek's open-source models

Usage Conditions:

- Directly visit the official website or download deepseek client

Limitations:

- Frequent service anomalies due to popularity and overseas computing power restrictions
- Gradually increased content moderation restrictions on the official website
- AIP services have currently suspended recharge services

Alternative Solutions:

Since the model is completely free and open-source, many platforms have deployed deepseek's models. Similar services can be found on:

- [Tencent Yuanbao](https://yuanbao.tencent.com/)
- [MetaSo AI Search](https://metaso.cn/)
- [Baidu AI Search](https://chat.baidu.com/)

These platforms offer convenient free access to deepseek's models but inevitably add content moderation restrictions for compliance.  

To reduce moderation, consider using API services from major platforms. Current tests show most APIs deliver original deepseek outputs. Note this only reduces output moderation rather than eliminating it (except for self-hosted solutions, which remain costly for individuals). Recommended API services:

- [302AI (API proxy provider with multi-vendor integration. Bind credit card for fee waiver)](https://partnershare.302.ai/LJMZAb)
- [Volcano Engine (Fastest and most stable currently)](https://www.volcengine.com/experience/ark?utm_term=202502dsinvite&ac=DSASUQY5&rc=ISR6MFPG)
- [SiliconFlow (Oversaturated market, free APIs mostly unusable)](https://cloud.siliconflow.cn/i/nhVU6aPT)

### [grok3](https://grok.com/) Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Reasons for Recommendation:

- Claims to be the most advanced AI model surpassing OpenAI and DeepSeek
- Fewer content moderation restrictions with high intelligence (main reason for recommendation)
- Stable performance with internet-connected deep search and organization features

### [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com/) Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

Reasons to Recommend:
